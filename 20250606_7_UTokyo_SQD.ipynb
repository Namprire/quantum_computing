    "## Overview\n",
    "The **Sample-Based Quantum Diagonalization (SQD)** method is designed to overcome limitations of exact diagonalization methods, making it suitable for handling large Hamiltonians with millions of interaction terms, such as those found in quantum chemistry. Using a sample-based approach, SQD projects and diagonalizes target Hamiltonians in a subspace formed by samples obtained from quantum circuits. These circuits are typically tailored to represent probable eigenstates of the target operator, enabling robust calculations even in the presence of quantum noise.\n",
    "\n",
    "This notebook guides you through the SQD Qiskit addon; you'll learn how the SQD method works and explore its application to a Fermionic Hamiltonian. The notebook is structured as follows:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Part 1: Tutorial**  \n",
    "    In Part 1, you will learn how to use a Qiskit addon to set up and execute the SQD method for a Hamiltonian describing the $N_2$ molecule in a given basis. This section will provide you with hands-on experience with Qiskit addons, focusing on **energy estimation** using quantum samples combined with classical solvers.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Part 2: Challenge**  \n",
    "    Once you've completed the tutorial, you'll move on to the challenge section. Here, you will be tasked with tuning parameters to improve the performance of SQD and achieve a closer approximation of the molecule's ground state energy. **Your goal** is to refine the parameters to enhance accuracy while considering noise and other quantum device constraints.\n",

    "In this tutorial we will implement a [Qiskit pattern](https://docs.quantum.ibm.com/guides/intro-to-patterns) showing how to post-process noisy quantum samples to find an approximation to the ground state of the $N_2$ molecule at equilibrium in the ``6-31G basis set``. We will follow a sample-based quantum diagonalization approach [[1]](https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.05068) to process samples taken from a ``36``-qubit quantum circuit (32 spin qubits + 4 auxiliary qubits). In order to account for the effect of quantum noise, the [self-configuration recovery technique is used](https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.05068).\n",
    "\n",
    "The pattern can be described in four steps:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Map to quantum problem**\n",
    "    - Generate an ansatz for estimating the ground state\n",
    "2. **Optimize the problem**\n",
    "    - Transpile the ansatz for the backend\n",
    "3. **Execute experiments**\n",
    "    - Draw samples from the ansatz using the ``Sampler`` primitive\n",
    "4. **Post-process results**\n",
    "   - Self-consistent configuration recovery loop\n",
    "       - Post-process the full set of bitstring samples, using prior knowledge of particle number and the average orbital occupancy calculated on the most recent iteration.\n",
    "       - Probabilistically create batches of subsamples from recovered bitstrings.\n",
    "       - Project and diagonalize the molecular Hamiltonian over each sampled subspace.\n",
    "       - Save the minimum ground state energy found across all batches and update the average orbital occupancy.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "For this example, the interacting-electron Hamiltonian takes the generic form:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\n",

These are loaded from an ``fcidump`` file with standard chemistry software.\n",

In this scenario, the diagonalization of the Hamiltonian projected into the subspace defined by $\\mathcal{S}$:\n",

First, a quantum circuit prepares the state $|\\Psi\\rangle$ in the quantum device. The Jordan-Wigner encoding is used. Consequently, members of the computational basis represent Fock states (electronic configurations/determinants). The circuit is sampled in the computational basis, yielding the set of noisy configurations $\\tilde{\\mathcal{X}}$. The configurations are represented by bitstrings. The set $\\tilde{\\mathcal{X}}$ is then passed into the classical post-processing block, where the [self-consistent configuration recovery technique](https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.05068) is used.
